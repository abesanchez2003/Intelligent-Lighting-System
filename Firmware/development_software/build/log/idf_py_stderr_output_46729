CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /Users/abe/Documents/Capstone_Firmware_Repo/Firmware/development_software/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /Users/abe/OneDrive - Texas A&M University/Spring_2025_Semester/ECEN_403/Firmware/development_software where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
